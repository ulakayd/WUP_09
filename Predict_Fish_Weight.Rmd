# Predicting Fish Weight


## Perch

```{r}
perchFish = filter (fishAll, Species =='Perch')
perchModel = lm(Weight~Length1+Length2+Length3+Height+Width,data=perchFish)
summary.lm(perchModel)
```

### Best Models

We find the best models for all three species 

### Best Two regressor model

```{r}
#best model
perchBest2= lm(Weight~Height+Width, data = perchFish)
summary.lm(perchBest2)
```

## Pike

```{r}
pikeFish = filter (fishAll, Species =='Pike')
pikeModel = lm(Weight~Length1+Length2+Length3+Height+Width,data=pikeFish)
summary.lm(pikeModel)
```
